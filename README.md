# Data Lab

## Introduction

ICS Data Lab, Peking University.

The purpose of this assignment is to become more familiar with bit-level representations of common patterns, integers, and floating-point numbers. You’ll do this by solving a series of programming “puzzles,” **using only bit-wise operations**. For more information about this lab, please refer to ```datalab.pdf```.

## Installation

It is recommended to do this lab on Ubuntu 20.04. Make sure you have the following package installed:
```
sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib
```

## Score

Your score will be computed out of a maximum of 80 points based on the following distribution:
- **48**: Correctness of code.
- **32**: Performance of code, based on number of operators used in each function.

The following table shows my score and the best score in my class. Some of my implementations are not optimal, and it is possible to finish them with fewer number of operations.
